# Mini-ERA FFT Kernels

These two FFT kernels (1D and 2D) are part of the benchmark suite for the DARPA PERFECT Program. Refer to https://hpc.pnl.gov/PERFECT/ for additional information.

Run `make` within each subfolder (`fft-1d` and `fft-2d`) to compile the code. The FFT size can be controller with the `INPUT_SIZE` definition within each `Makefile`.

The `main.exe` binary executes the program.
